##  Computer security

Any servers managed by lab
members for research purposes must meet the [Stanford Minimum Security Standards</span>](https://uit.stanford.edu/guide/securitystandards/cookbooks).

## Shared computing platforms

We use two primary shared
computing platforms:

-   [Stanford Research Computing Center](https://srcc.stanford.edu/)
-   [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/)

The decision regarding which
    platform to use will depend upon the specific needs of the project,
    and can be discussed with Dr. Poldrack or other experienced
    researchers in the lab.

### Shared computing etiquette

Lab members should follow good
shared computing etiquette:

- Never run a computing job on the login node
  - For testing purposes, you can access a development node.
- Keep in mind that our allocation on these systems is limited.
- Run a small test job before starting a large job
- Ensure that your jobs are efficiently using the system resources - if you aren’t sure, then
    ask for help!
- On systems where the lab has a
specific allocation of cores (e.g. Sherlock), don’t use all of the cores
at once unless having first discussed your needs at the lab meeting or
via the lab mailing list or Slack.
- Be sure to set up your
environment properly:
    - Always set your umask to
    allow group read/write; otherwise you may create files that can’t be
    modified by others in the group.
- Share your wisdom
  - If you encounter a problem
    that is not documented in the lab’s internal documentation, then add
    it to the documentation once you have solved it
  - If you encounter an error in the documentation, then flag it and/or fix it
  - You can refer to [this website](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/overview/introduction/)
    for more information on Sherlock, and if you have any further
    questions you can contact the Sherlock admis via email/Slack or meet
    during specific Office Hours as specified[here](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/overview/introduction/#office-hours).
-   Each TACC system has its own
    dedicated user guide that provides substantial information about how
    to use the system.
- Users of shared systems should
clean up directories as projects are completed, removing intermediate
files that are not necessary to keep. The storage of redundant data
should be avoided, except where required for backups.

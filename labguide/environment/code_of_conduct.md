All lab members and guests are
expected to adhere to the following code of conduct. In addition, all
Stanford University affiliates are required to adhere to the [University Code of
Conduct](https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-1/subchapter-1/policy-1-1-1).
For definitions of an act of intolerance & hate crime escalation policy
please see this page on University [AOI](https://deanofstudents.stanford.edu/acts-intolerance-protocol/overview/definitions).
If you wish to speak with someone outside of the lab regarding an
incident that occurred in or outside of the lab, the university has

## Statement of intent

Our lab is dedicated to
providing a safe and welcoming environment for everyone. We do not
tolerate harassment for any form of identity such as but not limited
to: sex, gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability
including mental illness, physical appearance, body size, race,
ethnicity, religion (including the lack thereof), or socioeconomic
status. We do not tolerate harassment of lab members or guests in
any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any lab
event or venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and
other online media.

## Details of Lab Code of Conduct

1.  Harassment includes offensive
verbal comments related to a person’s identity or presentation of
their identity. This can include denigrating comments,
microaggressions, or consistent interruption during talks or
presentations
2. [Sexual harassment includes](https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-1/subchapter-7/policy-1-7-1):
displays of sexual images in public lab spaces, deliberate
intimidation, stalking/ following, coerced photography or recording,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

## Responding to incidents

1. Lab members asked to stop any
    misconduct are expected to comply immediately. Justification for the
    request does not need to be provided, nor does the reporting party
    of the incident need to be identified.
2. If you are being harassed,
    notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
    concerns, please contact Dr. Poldrack as soon as possible. Anonymous
    comments may also be made to Dr. Poldrack using [this form](https://poldracklab.wufoo.com/forms/z5hpmzx1uf8hce/).
    If you are not comfortable contacting him directly, you may report
    your concerns to one of the [relevant Stanford University offices](https://diversityandaccess.stanford.edu/reporting-discrimination-concern)
    that are prepared to respond to harassment complaints.
3.  We expect lab members to
    follow this code of conduct at conferences and workshops and related
    social events, and whenever they are representing the lab in a
    professional context.
4.  When lab members are invited
    to participate in a professional event, they are expected to inquire
    regarding the steps that the organizers are taking to ensure
    diversity prior to accepting any invitation. This includes declining
    participation in exclusionary events such as panels or talks. For
    example, men in the lab should avoid participating in all-men panels
    whenever possible, keeping in mind that this may be more achievable
    for senior versus junior lab members.

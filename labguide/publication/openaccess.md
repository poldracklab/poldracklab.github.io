# Open access and preprints

## Open access

- When we select journals for
publication, we will prioritize publishing in journals that offer an
Open Access option. However,
we realize that sometimes the most appropriate journal for a particular
paper will be one that does not offer this option.
- When project funding is not
available for open access publication fees, Dr. Poldrack will cover
these fees using unrestricted funds.

## Preprints

- All papers should be uploaded to
a relevant preprint archive prior to or upon submission, unless the
target journal does not allow preprint publication.
- Our general policy is to avoid
publishing in journals that do not allow preprint posting, unless there
is a very strong reason to do so.

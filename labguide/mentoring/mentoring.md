# Training and Mentorship

This section of the guide is a first-person perspective from Dr. Poldrack.

## Undergraduate study

We are always looking for undergraduate students to get involved on a variety of projects! 
If you are a Stanford affiliate and in the area, feel free to fill out this [form](https://redcap.stanford.edu/surveys/?s=cN6fbYiPfp) and we will reach out to you.

## Graduate study

### What graduate programs are you affiliated with?
- I am affiliated with several graduate programs at Stanford: 
    - [Psychology](https://psychology.stanford.edu/phd-program)
    - [Neuroscience](https://med.stanford.edu/neurogradprogram.html)
    - [Bioengineering](https://bioengineering.stanford.edu/academics-admission/graduate-programs)
    - [Biomedical Data Science](https://dbds.stanford.edu/) (BMI)

### How do I choose a program?

In choosing a program, there are several important differences:

1.  *Research:* While most of
    these programs are fairly flexible, there are generally some
    expectations regarding the kind of research you will do, depending
    on the specific program. For example, if you are joining the BMI program then your
    work is expected to have at least some focus on novel data analysis or
    informatics methods, whereas if you are joining Psychology your work
    is expected to make some contact with psychological function. Having
    said that, most of what we do in our lab could be done by a student
    in any of these programs.
2.  *Coursework*: Perhaps the
    biggest difference between programs is the kind of courses you are
    required to take. Each program has a set of core requirements. In psychology, you will take
    a number of core courses in different areas of psychology
    (cognitive, neuroscience, social, affective, developmental). In the neuroscience program
    you will take a set of core modules spanning different areas of
    neuroscience (including one on cognitive neuroscience that Justin
    Gardner and I teach), whereas in BMI you take core courses around
    informatics-related topics. In each program you will also take elective courses (often
    outside the department) that establish complementary core knowledge
    that is important for your particular research; for example, you can
    take courses in our world-class statistics department regardless of
    which program you enroll in. One way to think about this is: What do you want to learn
    about that is outside of your specific content area? Take a look at
    the core courses in each program and see which ones interest you the
    most.
3.  *First-year experience*: In
    Psychology, students generally jump straight into a specific lab (or
    a collaboration between labs), and spend their first year doing a
    first-year project that they present to their area meeting at the
    end of the year. In Neuroscience and BMI, students do rotations in
    multiple labs in their first year, and are expected to pick a lab by
    the end of their first year. 
4.  *Admissions*: All of these
    programs are highly selective, but each differs in the nature of its
    admissions process. At
    one end of the spectrum is the Psychology admissions process, where
    initial decisions for who to interview are made by the combined
    faculty within each area of the department. At the other end is the
    Neuroscience program, where initial decisions are made by an
    admissions committee. As
    a generalization, I would say that the Psychology process is better
    for candidates whose interests and experience fit very closely with
    a specific PI or set of PIs, whereas the committee process caters
    towards candidates who may not have settled on a specific topic or
    PI.
5.  *Career positioning*: I think
    that the specific department that one graduates from matters a lot
    less than people think it does. For example, I have been in psychology departments that have
    hired faculty with PhDs in physics, applied mathematics, and computer
    science. I think that the work that you do and the skills that you
    acquire ultimately matter a lot more than the name of the program
    that is listed on your diploma. Having said that, you ultimately do need to position yourself
    so that a particular department will feel that you “fit” with them;
    this is often a challenge for people working on interdisciplinary
    topics, where sometimes it can be difficult to find a department who
    feels that the person fits well.

### What does it take to get accepted?

There are always more qualified applicants than there are
spots in our graduate programs, and there is no way to guarantee
admission to any particular program. On the flipside, there are also
no absolute requirements: we look at the whole picture, and other
factors can sometimes outweigh a weaker academic record. There are a few factors that are
particularly important for admission to my lab:

1.  *Research experience*: It is
    very rare for someone to be accepted into any of the programs I am
    affiliated with at Stanford without significant research
    experience. Sometimes
    this can be obtained as an undergraduate, but more often successful
    applicants to our program have spent at least a year working as a
    research assistant in an active research laboratory. There are a couple of
    important reasons for this. First, we want you to understand what you are getting into;
    many people have rosy ideas of what it’s like to be a scientist,
    which can fall away pretty quickly in light of the actual experience
    of doing science. Spending some time in a lab helps you make sure that this is
    how you want to spend your life. In addition, it provides you with
    someone who can write a recommendation letter that speaks very
    directly to your potential as a researcher. Letters are a very important
    part of the admissions process, and the most effective letters are
    those that go into specific detail about your abilities, aptitude,
    and motivation.
2.  *Technical skills*: The
    research that we do in our lab is highly technical, requiring
    knowledge of computing systems, programming, and
    math/statistics. I would
    say that decent programming ability is a pretty firm prerequisite
    for entering my lab; once you enter the lab I want you to be able to
    jump directly into doing science, and this just can’t happen if you
    have to spend a year teaching yourself how to program from scratch.
    More generally, we expect you to be able to pick up new technical
    topics easily; I don’t expect students to necessarily show up
    knowing how a reinforcement learning model works, but I expect them
    to be able to go and figure it out on their own by reading the
    relevant papers and then implement it on their own. The best way to
    demonstrate programming ability is to show a specific project that
    you have worked on. This could be an open source project that you
    have contributed to, or a project that you did on the side for fun
    (for example, mine your own social media feed, or program a
    cognitive task and measure how your own behavior changes from day to
    day). If you don’t currently know how to program, see my post on
    [learning to program from
    scratch](https://russpoldrack.blogspot.com/2016/05/advice-for-learning-to-code-from-scratch.html),
    and get going!
3.  c. *Risk taking and resilience:*
    If we are doing interesting science then things are going to fail,
    and we have to learn from those failures and move on.<span
    class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I want to know that you are
    someone who is willing to go out on a limb to try something risky,
    and can handle the inevitable failures gracefully.<span
    class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rather than seeing a
    statement of purpose that only lists all of your successes, I find
    it very useful to also know about risks you have taken (be they
    physical, social, or emotional), challenges you have faced, failures
    you have experienced, and most importantly what you learned from all
    of these experiences.

### What kind of advisor are you?
Different advisers have different philosophies, and it’s important to be
sure that you pick an advisor whose style is right for you. I would say that the most
important characteristic of my style is that I foster independent
thinking in my trainees. Publishing papers is important, but not as important as
developing one’s ability to conceive novel and interesting questions and
ask them in a rigorous way. This means that beyond the first year
project, I don’t generally hand my students problems to work on; rather,
I expect them to come up with their own questions, and then we work
together to devise the right experiments to test them. Another important
thing to know is that I try to motivate by example, rather than by
command. I rarely breathe down my trainees necks about getting their
work done, because I work on the assumption that they will be
self-motivated. On the other hand, I’m fairly hands-on in the sense that
I still love to get deep in the weeds of experimental design and data
analysis; for example, I will regularly code alongside lab members. I
would also add that I am highly amenable to joint mentorship with other
faculty.

### Can I meet with you to discuss my interests in your research?

I have instituted a policy that I will
no longer meet one-on-one with potential graduate students prior to the
application process to discuss potential admission into my lab, as this
has the potential to exacerbate existing disparities in graduate school
admissions. I am willing to
meet with individuals (particularly those from underrepresented groups)
to discuss the graduate admissions process and other academic issues
more generally, as time permits.

  
## Postdoctoral training in the lab

### How can I get a postdoc position in your lab?

- We do not generally advertise
    postdoctoral positions, so if you are interested in a position in
    the lab, contact Dr. Poldrack directly. Be sure to send your CV, and
    explain in brief your research interests and why you think you would
    be a good fit for the lab.
    
## Mentoring practices

### Weekly report

Graduate students in the lab are expected to keep suitable documentation 
    for all research activities (i.e. a github log, a google doc, etc).

### Scheduling meetings with me

Dr. Poldrack provides all lab
    members with access to a scheduling system with which they can
    schedule meetings during any open times on his calendar.
- Upon request, lab members can
    schedule a regular standing meeting.

## “Lifetime guarantee”

I view mentorship as a
    life-long relationship, and you can view working with me as having a
    “Lifetime Guarantee” in the sense that I will always be there to
    help you, even long after you have left the lab -- from letters of
    recommendation to career mentorship to personal advice.

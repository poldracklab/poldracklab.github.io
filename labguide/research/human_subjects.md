# Human subjects research

-   All lab members engaged in
    research must complete the relevant human subjects training through
    [CITI](https://researchcompliance.stanford.edu/panels/hs/forms/training/citi).
    A detailed list of relevant training courses is provided to new
    members as part of the lab’s internal onboarding materials.  
-   If unsure if you are doing human subjects research, you can use the 
    [NIH Decision Tool](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/humansubjects/hs-decision.htm)
-   No personal identifiers
    should ever be associated with data recorded in the laboratory. This
    includes the [18 identifiers specified by
    HIPAA](https://cphs.berkeley.edu/hipaa/hipaa18.html), as well
    as any other identifiers that could potentially be used to
    re-identify an individual.
-   All brain imaging data should
    be defaced prior to analysis and sharing. Behavioural data should
    not contain personal identifiers (such as for example Amazon Turk ID
    for data collected online).  
-   Demographic data must be
    obtained for all subjects, in order to fulfill NIH inclusion
    reporting requirements and IRB documentation.
-   Redcap should be used for
    recruitment and screening, as well as e-consents.  
-   IRB maintenance is done by
    the research coordinators or the person leading the project.  
-   All projects considered a
    clinical trial should be posted on ClinicalTrials.gov
-   For more information on ethics regarding human subject research,
    you can watch Stanford's 
    [MED 255 videos on Biomedical Ethics](https://med.stanford.edu/bioethics/education/rcr/med-255-videos.html)

Our lab is focused on understanding how the brain gives rise to adaptive human behaviors.  We use a combination of functional neuroimaging, cognitive psychology, and computational modeling to address this question.  We also develop tools and infrastructure to make neuroscience more transparent and reproducible.

In the Poldrack Lab, we want all of our lab members to feel valued,
appreciated, safe, and free to be who they are. We embrace diversity and
are committed to preventing discrimination against people based on
gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity,
religion, age, neurodiversity, disability status, citizenship, or any
other feature that makes them unique.

We have an online [Lab Guide](labguide/index.html) that outlines our lab's values, principles, and practices.
